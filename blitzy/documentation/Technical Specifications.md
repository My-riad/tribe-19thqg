# Technical Specifications

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Tribe is an AI-powered matchmaking and engagement platform designed to create and sustain meaningful small-group connections (4-8 people) and encourage users to transition from digital to physical interactions. The platform specifically focuses on local connections and caters to introverts who may find traditional social networking challenging.

The core business problem Tribe addresses is the growing disconnect between online social networking and meaningful in-person relationships. Despite the proliferation of social media platforms, many people report feeling increasingly isolated and struggle to form genuine connections in their local communities.

#### Key Stakeholders and Users:

| Stakeholder Group | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Primary Users | Individuals seeking meaningful local connections, particularly introverts |
| Community Organizers | Users who create and manage Tribes |
| Local Businesses | Partners for events, venues, and promotional opportunities |
| Investors | Financial backers interested in social technology innovation |

#### Value Proposition:

Tribe differentiates itself by using AI to actively facilitate real-world connections through personality-based matchmaking, automated group formation, and AI-driven engagement tools that encourage and simplify in-person meetups.

### 1.2 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

#### 1.2.1 Project Context

Tribe positions itself in the market as a hybrid between traditional social networks and event planning platforms, with a unique focus on small group dynamics and AI-facilitated real-world interactions. Unlike existing social platforms that primarily focus on digital engagement or one-to-one connections, Tribe emphasizes small group formation based on psychological compatibility and shared interests.

The platform enters a market where users are increasingly experiencing "digital fatigue" and seeking more meaningful connections. Current solutions either lack the psychological foundation for effective group matching or fail to bridge the gap between online interaction and real-world meetups.

#### 1.2.2 High-Level Description

Tribe's primary capabilities include AI-powered matchmaking, personality-based user profiling, AI-driven engagement tools, real-time event recommendations, and optimized planning features.

The system architecture follows a mobile-first approach with a cross-platform application built on React Native, supported by a Node.js backend and leveraging AI services through OpenRouter API.

Major system components include:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| User Profiling System | Collects and analyzes personality traits, interests, and communication styles |
| AI Matchmaking Engine | Forms balanced groups based on compatibility algorithms |
| Engagement Platform | Provides tools for communication, planning, and activity coordination |
| Event Discovery System | Curates and recommends local activities based on group preferences |
| Planning & Logistics Module | Handles scheduling, reservations, and payment splitting |

The core technical approach leverages AI for both initial matchmaking and ongoing engagement, with continuous learning to improve recommendations based on user behavior and feedback.

#### 1.2.3 Success Criteria

##### Measurable Objectives:
- Achieve 50% of matched groups meeting in person within 2 weeks of formation
- Maintain 70% user retention rate after 3 months

## 5. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### 5.1 HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE

#### 5.1.1 System Overview

Tribe employs a microservices-based architecture to support its AI-powered matchmaking and engagement platform. This architectural approach was selected to enable independent scaling of critical components, facilitate rapid feature development, and support the diverse technical requirements of the system.

- **Architectural Style**: Microservices architecture with event-driven communication patterns for real-time features and RESTful APIs for synchronous operations
- **Key Architectural Principles**:
  - Separation of concerns between user-facing services and AI processing components
  - Event-driven design for real-time notifications and updates
  - Domain-driven design for clear boundaries between business capabilities
  - Cloud-native approach for scalability and resilience
  - Mobile-first design with offline capabilities

- **System Boundaries**:
  - Client applications (iOS and Android) as the primary user interface
  - External service integrations for events, payments, and location data
  - AI services boundary for personality analysis and matchmaking
  - Data persistence layer for user profiles, tribes, and engagement metrics

#### 5.1.2 Core Components Table

| Component Name | Primary Responsibility | Key Dependencies | Critical Considerations |

#### 5.1.3 Data Flow Description

The Tribe platform's data flows are centered around user profiles, tribe interactions, and event coordination:

- **User Onboarding Flow**: User registration data flows from the Mobile Client to the Authentication Service, which creates user credentials. The Profile Service then collects personality assessment data, which is processed by the AI Engine to generate a personality profile stored in the User Database.

- **Matchmaking Flow**: The Profile Service provides user profile data to the Matching Service, which uses the AI Engine to analyze compatibility and form tribes. Match results flow to the Tribe Service, which creates tribe entities and notifies users via the Notification Service.

- **Engagement Flow**: User interactions within tribes flow from the Mobile Client to the Tribe Service. The Engagement Service monitors activity levels and uses the AI Engine to generate contextual prompts and challenges, which are delivered to users via the Notification Service.

- **Event Planning Flow**: The Event Service aggregates data from external Event APIs and the user's location to generate recommendations. The Planning Service coordinates scheduling by collecting availability data from tribe members, determining optimal meeting times, and managing RSVPs. Booking confirmations flow through the Payment Service for financial transactions.

- **Data Persistence Strategy**: User profiles, personality data, and tribe relationships are stored in the primary PostgreSQL database. Real-time chat messages use Redis for temporary storage before being persisted. Event recommendations and activity data are cached for performance but refreshed regularly from external sources.

| gRPC | High-performance internal service calls | Used for AI service communication |

##### Service Discovery and Load Balancing

| Component | Implementation | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Service Registry | Consul | Dynamic service registration and discovery |
| API Gateway | Kong | Request routing, authentication, rate limiting |
| Load Balancer | NGINX | Traffic distribution across service instances |
| Health Checks | Consul + Custom endpoints | Service availability monitoring |

The system implements a service mesh pattern where each service registers with Consul upon startup. The API Gateway uses this registry to route requests to appropriate service instances, with NGINX providing load balancing across multiple instances of each service.

##### Circuit Breaker and Resilience Patterns

| Pattern | Implementation | Purpose |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Circuit Breaker | Hystrix/Resilience4j | Prevent cascading failures across services |
| Retry Mechanism | Exponential backoff | Handle transient failures in service calls |
| Fallback Strategy | Cached responses | Provide degraded functionality when services fail |
| Bulkhead Pattern | Thread pool isolation | Contain failures to specific components |

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Closed
    Closed --> Open: Error threshold exceeded
    Open --> HalfOpen: Timeout period elapsed
    HalfOpen --> Closed: Success threshold met
    HalfOpen --> Open: Errors continue
    Open --> [*]: Service restored
```

#### 6.1.2 SCALABILITY DESIGN

##### Scaling Approach

Tribe implements a hybrid scaling strategy tailored to each service's requirements:

| Service | Scaling Approach | Rationale |
|---------|------------------|-----------|
| Authentication Service | Horizontal | High request volume, stateless operations |
| Profile Service | Horizontal with caching | Read-heavy workload |
| Tribe Service | Horizontal with sharding | Group-based data partitioning |
| Matching Service | Vertical + Horizontal | Compute-intensive operations |
| AI Orchestration Service | Vertical | Resource-intensive AI processing |
| Event/Planning Services | Horizontal | Geographically distributed load |

##### Auto-scaling Configuration

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Auto-scaling Workflow"
        A[Monitoring System] -->|Collects Metrics| B[Metrics Analysis]
        B -->|Triggers Based on Rules| C{Scale Decision}
        C -->|Scale Out| D[Provision New Instances]
        C -->|Scale In| E[Terminate Excess Instances]
        D --> F[Register with Service Discovery]
        E --> G[Graceful Shutdown]
        F --> H[Join Load Balancer Pool]
        G --> I[Remove from Load Balancer]
    end
```

| Service | Scale-Out Trigger | Scale-In Trigger | Min/Max Instances |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Authentication | CPU > 70% for 3 min | CPU < 30% for 10 min | 2/10 |
| Profile | Request queue > 100 | Request queue < 10 for 5 min | 2/8 |
| Tribe | Active connections > 1000 | Active connections < 200 for 15 min | 2/12 |
| Matching | Job queue > 50 | Job queue empty for 10 min | 1/6 |
| AI Orchestration | GPU utilization > 80% | GPU utilization < 40% for 15 min | 1/4 |

##### Resource Allocation Strategy

| Service | CPU Allocation | Memory Allocation | Storage Requirements |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Authentication | 1-2 vCPUs | 2-4 GB RAM | 10 GB SSD |
| Profile | 2-4 vCPUs | 4-8 GB RAM | 50 GB SSD |
| Tribe | 2-4 vCPUs | 4-8 GB RAM | 100 GB SSD |
| Matching | 4-8 vCPUs | 8-16 GB RAM | 20 GB SSD |
| AI Orchestration | 4-8 vCPUs + GPU | 16-32 GB RAM | 50 GB SSD |
| Databases | 8-16 vCPUs | 32-64 GB RAM | 500 GB-1 TB SSD |

##### Performance Optimization Techniques

| Technique | Implementation | Services Affected |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Caching | Redis for frequently accessed data | Profile, Tribe, Event |
| Connection Pooling | Database connection management | All database-dependent services |
| Asynchronous Processing | Background job queues for non-critical operations | Matching, Notification, AI |
| Data Partitioning | Sharding by tribe ID and geographic region | Tribe, Event, Planning |
| Read Replicas | For read-heavy services | Profile, Event |

##### Fault Tolerance Mechanisms

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Fault Tolerance Architecture"
        A[Client Request] --> B[API Gateway]
        B --> C{Service Available?}
        C -->|Yes| D[Process Normally]
        C -->|No| E{Fallback Available?}
        E -->|Yes| F[Execute Fallback]
        E -->|No| G[Graceful Degradation]

| Data Corruption | Point-in-time recovery | < 60 minutes | < 24 hours |
| Complete System Failure | Infrastructure as Code restoration | < 4 hours | < 1 hour |

##### Data Redundancy Approach

| Data Type | Redundancy Strategy | Backup Frequency | Retention Period |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------|------------------|
| User Profiles | Multi-region database replication | Real-time | Indefinite |
| Tribe Data | Database replication + daily snapshots | Real-time + Daily | 90 days |
| Chat History | Database replication + archiving | Real-time + Weekly | 1 year |
| Event Data | Multi-region replication | Real-time | 1 year |
| System Configurations | Version-controlled infrastructure as code | Per change | Indefinite |

##### Service Degradation Policies

```mermaid

    E --> I[Disable Temporarily]
    F --> J[Disable Until System Recovery]
    
    G --> K[Authentication, Basic Tribe Functions]
    H --> L[Matching with Cached Data, Basic Chat]
    I --> M[AI Recommendations, Advanced Planning]
    J --> N[Analytics, Non-critical Notifications]
```

| Degradation Level | Affected Features | User Impact | Recovery Criteria |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Level 1 (Minor) | AI recommendations, advanced planning | Reduced personalization | CPU < 70%, Memory < 80% |
| Level 2 (Moderate) | Real-time features, matching quality | Delayed responses, basic matching | CPU < 60%, Memory < 70% |
| Level 3 (Severe) | New tribe formation, event creation | Limited to existing interactions | CPU < 50%, Memory < 60% |
| Level 4 (Critical) | Read-only mode | No new interactions | Manual intervention required |

The system implements feature toggles that can be dynamically adjusted based on system health metrics, allowing for graceful degradation during high load or partial outages while maintaining core functionality.

## 6.3 INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE

The Tribe platform requires extensive integration with external systems to deliver its core functionality. This section outlines the integration architecture that enables AI-powered matchmaking, real-world event discovery, payment processing, and other essential features.

### 6.3.1 API DESIGN

#### Protocol Specifications

| Protocol | Usage | Implementation | Security Considerations |
|----------|-------|----------------|------------------------|
| REST | Primary API protocol | JSON over HTTPS | TLS 1.3, CORS policy |
| WebSocket | Real-time communications | Socket.io | Authentication token validation |
| GraphQL | Complex data queries | Apollo Server | Query complexity limits |
| Webhook | External event notifications | HTTP POST callbacks | HMAC signature verification |

The Tribe platform primarily uses RESTful APIs for most service-to-service and client-server communications, with WebSockets for real-time features like chat and notifications. GraphQL is implemented for complex data retrieval operations where clients need flexible query capabilities.

#### Authentication Methods

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client Request] --> B{Authentication Type}
    B -->|User Authentication| C[JWT Token]
    B -->|Service-to-Service| D[API Key + HMAC]
    B -->|Third-party OAuth| E[OAuth 2.0 Flow]
    B -->|Webhook| F[Signature Verification]
    
    C --> G[Validate Token]
    D --> H[Verify API Key & Signature]
    E --> I[Validate OAuth Token]
    F --> J[Verify Webhook Signature]
    
    G --> K{Valid?}
    H --> K
    I --> K
    J --> K
    
    K -->|Yes| L[Process Request]
    K -->|No| M[Return 401 Unauthorized]
```

| Auth Method | Use Case | Implementation | Token Lifespan |
|-------------|----------|----------------|----------------|
| JWT | User authentication | Bearer token in Authorization header | Access: 15 min, Refresh: 7 days |
| API Keys | Service-to-service | Key ID + HMAC signature | Rotated quarterly |
| OAuth 2.0 | Third-party integrations | Authorization code flow | Based on provider (typically 60 min) |
| Webhook Signatures | Incoming webhooks | HMAC-SHA256 signature | Per-request verification |

#### Authorization Framework

The platform implements a multi-layered authorization framework:

| Authorization Layer | Implementation | Purpose |
|---------------------|----------------|---------|
| Role-Based Access Control | User roles and permissions | Control access to administrative functions |
| Resource-Based Authorization | Ownership and membership checks | Ensure users can only access their data and tribes |
| Attribute-Based Access | Feature flags and user status | Control access to premium features |
| Scoped Tokens | OAuth scopes for third-party access | Limit third-party access to specific resources |

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Request with Authentication] --> B[Extract Identity]
    B --> C[Determine Roles/Permissions]
    C --> D{Resource Access?}
    
    D -->|User Resource| E{Resource Owner?}
    D -->|Tribe Resource| F{Tribe Member?}
    D -->|Admin Resource| G{Admin Role?}
    
    E -->|Yes| H[Grant Access]
    E -->|No| I[Access Denied]
    
    F -->|Yes| J{Permission Level?}
    F -->|No| I
    
    G -->|Yes| H
    G -->|No| I
    
    J -->|Sufficient| H
    J -->|Insufficient| I
```

#### Rate Limiting Strategy

| API Category | Rate Limit | Window | Overage Handling |
|--------------|------------|--------|------------------|
| Public APIs | 60 requests | Per minute | 429 Too Many Requests |
| Authenticated APIs | 300 requests | Per minute | 429 with Retry-After header |
| Critical Operations | 10 requests | Per minute | Exponential backoff required |
| AI Operations | 30 requests | Per minute | Queue with priority system |

The system implements a token bucket algorithm for rate limiting with the following features:
- Per-user and per-IP rate limiting
- Burst allowance for legitimate traffic spikes
- Rate limit headers in responses (X-RateLimit-*)
- Graduated throttling based on user tier

#### Versioning Approach

| Versioning Component | Strategy | Example |
|----------------------|----------|---------|
| API Version | URI path prefix | `/v1/tribes` |
| Data Models | Schema versioning | `"schemaVersion": "2.1"` |
| Backward Compatibility | Minimum 6 months | Deprecation notices in headers |
| Breaking Changes | Major version increment | v1 → v2 |
| Non-breaking Additions | Minor version increment | v1.1 → v1.2 |

The API versioning strategy follows these principles:
- All endpoints include version in the path
- Multiple versions supported simultaneously during transition periods
- Deprecation notices provided at least 3 months before end-of-life
- Version-specific documentation maintained for all active versions
