**Build an MVP for Tribe, an AI-powered matchmaking and engagement platform designed to create and sustain meaningful small-group connections (4-8 people) and encourage people to go from the digital to the physical, with a specific focus on local connections and introverts. The platform should use AI to form well-balanced groups based on psychology, shared interests, and communication styles. It should also provide AI-driven engagement tools, real-time event/activity recommendations, and optimized planning features.**
