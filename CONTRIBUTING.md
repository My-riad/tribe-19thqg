## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

We follow a feature branch workflow:

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `staging` - Pre-production testing
- `development` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - Individual feature branches
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fix branches
- `hotfix/*` - Urgent fixes for production

### Making Changes

1. **Sync with Upstream**
   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git pull upstream development
   ```

2. **Create a Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make Your Changes**
   - Write code that adheres to our coding standards
   - Add or update tests as necessary
   - Update documentation to reflect your changes

4. **Commit Your Changes**
   We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   ```

   Common types include:
   - `feat`: A new feature
   - `fix`: A bug fix
   - `docs`: Documentation changes
   - `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
   - `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
   - `perf`: Performance improvements
   - `test`: Adding or updating tests
   - `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

5. **Push Your Branch**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Go to the repository on GitHub
   - Create a new pull request from your branch to the `development` branch
   - Fill in the pull request template with all required information
   - Request reviews from appropriate team members

## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- Write clean, readable, and self-documenting code
- Follow the principle of least surprise
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Comment complex logic, but prefer readable code over excessive comments
- Write code that is testable and maintainable

### JavaScript/TypeScript Standards

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow the ESLint and Prettier configurations provided in the project
- Use async/await for asynchronous code instead of callbacks or raw promises
- Prefer functional programming patterns where appropriate
- Use destructuring and spread operators for cleaner code
- Avoid any usage of `any` type in TypeScript
- Use proper error handling with try/catch blocks

### React/React Native Standards

- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use proper component composition
- Follow the container/presentational component pattern
- Use React Context and Redux appropriately based on state scope
- Optimize renders with useMemo, useCallback, and React.memo where appropriate
- Follow accessibility best practices

### Backend Standards

- Follow RESTful API design principles
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Write efficient database queries
- Implement proper logging
- Follow security best practices
- Design for scalability and performance

### Documentation Standards

- Document all public APIs, interfaces, and complex functions
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Use JSDoc for JavaScript/TypeScript documentation
- Document architectural decisions and patterns
- Include examples where appropriate

## Testing Requirements

All code contributions must include appropriate tests. We maintain high test coverage to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

### Testing Frameworks

- **Backend**: Jest for unit and integration tests
- **Frontend**: Jest with React Testing Library for component tests

### Types of Tests

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual functions and components in isolation
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Focus on testing business logic and edge cases

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test interactions between components or services
   - Test API endpoints with realistic data
   - Verify database interactions

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Test complete user flows
   - Simulate real user interactions
   - Verify system behavior as a whole

### Coverage Requirements

- **Backend**: Minimum 85% coverage for statements, branches, functions, and lines
- **Frontend**: Minimum 80% coverage for statements, branches, functions, and lines

### Running Tests

```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend
npm test                 # Run all tests
npm run test:unit        # Run unit tests only
npm run test:integration # Run integration tests only
npm run test:coverage    # Generate coverage report

# Frontend tests
cd src/web
npm test                 # Run all tests
npm run test:watch       # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage    # Generate coverage report
```

### Test Best Practices

- Write tests that are deterministic and repeatable
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Use test fixtures and factories for test data
- Keep tests independent and isolated
- Avoid testing implementation details when possible

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Ensure all tests pass**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend
   npm test
   
   # Frontend

   ```

2. **Run linting checks**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend
   npm run lint
   
   # Frontend
   cd src/web
   npm run lint
   ```

3. **Verify that your code meets coverage requirements**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend
   npm run test:coverage
   
   # Frontend
   cd src/web
   npm run test:coverage
   ```

4. **Update documentation** if your changes affect public APIs or user-facing features

5. **Ensure your branch is up-to-date** with the latest changes from the development branch
   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git pull upstream development
   git checkout your-feature-branch
   git rebase development
   ```
