# Tribe Platform Data Model Architecture

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the data model architecture for the Tribe platform. The data model is designed to support the core functionality of creating meaningful small-group connections (4-8 people) and facilitating the transition from digital to physical interactions. The database schema is implemented using PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for type-safe database access.

## Database Technology Stack

The Tribe platform uses the following database technologies:

### Primary Database

PostgreSQL 15+ is used as the primary relational database for its robust support of complex relationships, ACID compliance, and advanced query capabilities. PostgreSQL was chosen for its ability to handle the complex social relationships and group dynamics central to the Tribe platform.

### Extensions

The following PostgreSQL extensions are utilized:
- PostGIS: For location-based queries and geospatial functionality
- uuid-ossp: For UUID generation
- pg_trgm: For text search and similarity matching

### ORM

Prisma 4.16+ serves as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) layer, providing type-safe database access with migration support. Prisma was selected for its TypeScript integration, schema-based approach, and developer-friendly API.

### Supplementary Storage

In addition to PostgreSQL, the platform uses:
- Redis: For caching, session storage, and real-time features
- Amazon S3: For media storage (user uploads, profile images)
- ElasticSearch: For advanced search capabilities
- TimescaleDB: For time-series data (engagement metrics, activity tracking)

## Core Entity Relationships

The data model is organized around several core entities that form the foundation of the Tribe platform. The following diagram illustrates the high-level relationships between these entities:

## Data Migration Strategy

This section outlines the approach to database schema evolution and data migration.

### Schema Evolution

The Tribe platform uses Prisma Migrate for schema evolution with the following principles:

- All schema changes are version-controlled in the repository
- Migrations are created using Prisma Migrate and reviewed before application
- Backward compatibility is maintained whenever possible
- Breaking changes require a migration plan with data transformation
- All migrations are tested in development and staging environments before production
- Rollback plans are created for complex migrations

### Migration Process

The migration process follows these steps:

1. Developer updates schema.prisma file with changes
2. Prisma Migrate generates migration files
3. Migration is tested in development environment
4. Migration is reviewed by team members
5. Migration is applied to staging environment and tested
6. Migration is scheduled for production deployment
7. Migration is applied during maintenance window
8. Verification tests confirm successful migration

### Data Transformation

For migrations requiring data transformation, the following approaches are used:

- Simple transformations are included in migration files
- Complex transformations use separate scripts
- Large data transformations are performed in batches
- Temporary tables are used for complex restructuring
- Data validation is performed before and after transformation

## Performance Considerations

This section outlines key performance considerations for the data model.

### Query Optimization

Strategies for optimizing database queries:

- Use appropriate indexes for common query patterns
- Implement query parameterization to leverage prepared statements
- Use pagination for large result sets
- Implement denormalization for frequently accessed data
- Use materialized views for complex aggregations
- Optimize joins with appropriate indexes
- Use database-specific features like PostgreSQL's JSONB for flexible data

### Connection Pooling

Connection pooling configuration for optimal database performance:

- min_connections: 5
- max_connections: 20
- idle_timeout: 10000
- connection_timeout: 3000
- strategy: Maintain a balance between resource utilization and availability

### Scaling Considerations

Approaches for scaling the database as the platform grows:

- Vertical scaling for initial growth phases
- Read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Sharding by tribe ID for very large deployments
- Caching layer to reduce database load
- Archiving historical data to maintain performance

## Security and Compliance

This section outlines data security and compliance considerations.

### Data Classification

Classification of data types by sensitivity:

| Level | Data Types | Protection |
|-------|------------|------------|
| Highly Sensitive | Authentication credentials, Payment information, Personality assessment data | Encryption at rest and in transit, field-level encryption, access logging |
| Sensitive | Personal contact information, Location data, Private messages | Encryption at rest and in transit, role-based access control |
| Internal | Tribe information, Event details, User interests | Standard access controls, encryption in transit |
| Public | Public tribe listings, Public event information | Integrity controls |

### Data Protection Measures

Measures implemented to protect sensitive data:

- Encryption of sensitive data at rest using AES-256
- TLS 1.3 for all data in transit
- Field-level encryption for highly sensitive data
- Role-based access control for database access
- Audit logging for sensitive data access
- Data minimization principles applied throughout the model
- Automated data retention and purging policies

### Compliance Considerations
